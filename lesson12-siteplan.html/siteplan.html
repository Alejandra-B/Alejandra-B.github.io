        Color Palette

    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

    <p>
        Palette URL:
        <a href="https://coolors.co/05668d-028090-00a896-02c39a-f0f3bd"

    <h3>
        Typography
    </h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
        Heading Font: [Satisfy]
        <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <p>
        I think that Satisfy is a clear, wild and clean font, just like the
        whitewater raftings. It will give a nice, crisp and strong finish to the
        title.
        <!-- change this -->

    <h4>
        Paragraph Font: [Roboto]
        <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <p>
        I think that Roboto is a font that looks very readable, young and
        perfect for this kind of business.

    <h4>
        Normal paragraph example

        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it soundsâ€¦it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.
    </p>
    <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxesâ€¦ Some suggestions are below:

â€¢	FAQ

    <h2>
        Wireframes
    </h2>
    <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
            means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
            screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
            Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
            icons.
        </li>
    </ol>
