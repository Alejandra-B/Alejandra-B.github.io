                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Glendale was founded in 1892 by William John Murphy, primarily because of the fertile land of the
                    Salt River Valley, which
                    was ideal for agriculture.</p>

                <p>"The basis of Glendale's economic progress throughout its 100 year history as a community might be
                    best summed up by two words: water and transportation. More than just supporting the usual needs of
                    the city's population, water actually created Glendale's industry.

                    The Arizona Jack SwillingCanal and Roosevelt Dam assured a stable water supply and freedom from the
                    effects of droughts and floods.As a result of these water sources, Glendale became an agricultural
                    mecca, specializing in lettuce, melons, sugar beets, and cotton.

                    Phoenix's founder Jack Swilling, re-excavated a network of
                    prehistoric Hohokam Indian canals that irrigated thousands of acres of farmland along the Salt
                    River. His efforts also helped give birth to Southeast Valley Settlements that became the cities of
                    Tempe and Mesa.

                    Unfortunately, for the northern and western portions of the Salt River Valley, no Indian Canals were
                    there to restore. So the lands that make up Northwest Phoenix, Glendale and Peoria today remained
                    raw desert more than 15 years after the East Jack SwillingValley cities had already been settled.
                    For the baren Northwest Valley to come to life, it, too, needed that all-powerful
                    resource--water."(Article published by goglendaleaz.com)
