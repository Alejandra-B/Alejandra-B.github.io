            <h3>Contrast</h3>

            <p class="underarmour">Contrast is when two or more very different (opposite) elements are placed together on the page. It
                can aid to legibly improve, visual interest,
                organization and hierarchy, and in highlighting main messages.
                Contrast is achieved using colors, sizes, shapes, textures, saturation, and position or
                alignment.<br>
                This Underarmour Sports Wear advertisement is a good example of contrast with the use
                of opposite colors and textures. The home page features red, black and white colors on the image and
                fonts that contrast each other
                making them "pop" on the page attracting the viewer's attention.

            </p>
            <p class="pbs">The Principle of Repetition is applied when the same or similar elements are used throughout a
                design. It portraits a sense of harmony and consistency.<br> PBS KIDS home page is a perfect example
                of
                repetition in design. The logo's circle shape is also utilized on all the site's icons. </p>

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Dillar's</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.dillards.com/">dillards.com</a></p>
            <p><img src="images/dillards.jpg" 
                    alt="Screen shot of dillars.com Website on cell phone view. Home page shows the deal of the week and the images of the end of the season clearance" class="imagethree">
            </p>
            <p class="dillards">Visual Hierarchy is a fundamental principle in design. It's the arrangement of elements on the page
                in order of importance. It can be achieved with the proper use of scale, colors and contrast, type,
                spacing, and composition.
                It helps the viewer focus and aids in helping them understand the information in a clear way.
                It also influences on the user's
                discernment and leads them to actions. <br>
                The image above from Dillard's Stores home page is a great
                example where
                Visual Hierarchy has been applied. In order of importance:
                <br>
                #1 Image of the "Face masks" and it respective 40% off advertisement. <br>
                #2 "End of Season Clearance" section with all the different images perfectly lined up.<br>
                #3 Logo <br>
                #4 Navigation Bar<br>
                #5 Footer and Search input area.
